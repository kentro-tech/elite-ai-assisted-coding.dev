    "text": "I decided to try AMP, a new AI agent tool. I gave it a real-world task: creating the “Layouts Concepts” documentation for a new open-source web framework called Air. This involved both coding (because I needed to understand it myself by building some examples) and then actually writing the documentation on it. It was something that I actually needed to get done, making it a nice realistic task to test whether it could be useful to me. The PR was accepted and merged.\nThis review covers the entire process, from setting up AMP and generating a working application to writing the final documentation and seeing diffs and explaining what I needed to do myself and how editing the Agent’s output felt.\nTLDR: It was a very powerful coding tool that did much better than I expected and is worth trying."

These needed to be matched up to a HTML reference documentation, and agents kept leaving off or added tags. Cursor’s tab comletion let me copy/paste from reference docs then hit tab for it to tab complete and modify to python syntax very quickly. It got the pattern after the first couple and let me get through it all in very little time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnhelpful Use Case\n\n\n\nI was working on creating examples for a workshop I was teaching on FastHTML Syntax and Project Organization. The tab completion was extremely annoying, because it was project wide it kept trying to autocomplete and change my code to what I did somewhere else.

However, not every tool or library provides curated context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood For\n\n\n\n\nYou want to explore more deeply\nIt’s provided by the tool author in some format\n\n\n\n\n_BraintrustPhoenixInspectManual Approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.0.1 MCP (Model Context Protocol)\nBraintrust provides a MCP server that your AI agents can use. This is a lot like GitMCP we saw above, but created by the Braintrust team specifically for Braintrust so it’s much better.\n\nOfficial MCP server: https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/reference/mcp\nProvides structured access to Braintrust functionality\n\nTo set up the MCP server with Cursor, you can use the following settings.\n\n\n\nCursor MCP Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nCursor MCP Json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.0.2 LLMs.txt\nPhoenix provides an file based in the llms.txt spec format. This is a format that allows for use as static context in a flat file, or as a tool that an MCP server can use to crawl it agentally.\n\nStandard Format for Pheonix: https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/llms.txt\nLangchain MCP documentation tool: https://github.com/langchain-ai/mcpdoc\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.0.3 llms.txt\nFor Pheonix, I provided a link to lanchain’s MCP server that lets you use the llms.txt file as a tool. For Inspect, let’s use the llms.txt spec to use the flat files as context to see the difference.\n\nStandard format: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/llms.txt\nFull version: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/llms-full.txt\nIndividual Pages as Context: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/index.html.md\n\n\n\n\nManual curation of context is also a great way to have the most control. There is typically a tradeoff between the amount of time you spend curating the context and the quality of the context. You will get better results if you spend more time carefully curating the context, and whether that payoff is worth the time is dependent on a few things:\n\nHow long will you be using this tool and how much? If you use it daily and will for years, it’s worth the time to curate the context.\nHow good is the library provided context? If they have carefully curated the context for llms specifically and the tool authors use it themselves, the often it works pretty great out of the box. Sadly, most tools don’t do this (yet).\n\n\n5.0.0.4 Jina AI\nJina AI is an easy way to turn any html page into a markdown file. Markdown is much better context for HTML, because there’s loads of unneccesary noise in the HTML that doesn’t add value (styling classes, js interactivity, server calls, social media icons, etc.)\n\n\n\n5.0.0.5 Copy Outer HTML\nBy going more manual you can remove the noise and get a more focused context. This is a great way to get a more focused context, but it’s a more work. The main benefits here over Jina AI is you often can remove lots of unneeded sections like footers, table of contents, sidebars, navigation, etc.\nCopying the outer HTML and feeding that into Web2Md is the best workflow I’ve found for this.\n\n\n\n5.0.0.6 Web 2 MD"
