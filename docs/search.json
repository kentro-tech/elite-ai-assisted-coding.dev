    "text": "Twitter Thread: AMP Tool Review\nTweet 1/8\nI put a new AI agent, AMP, to a real-world test. The task? Create the “Layouts Concepts” guide for Air, a brand-new OSS web framework. This meant I had to code examples and write the docs for them. The PR was accepted & merged!\nHere’s how it went. 🧵\n\n\n\nThe blog post title card for the AMP tool review\n\n\nTweet 2/8\nThe challenge: Air is a new framework currently in alpha. This means it’s not in any major AI model’s training data, making it a perfect test for an agent’s ability to learn from the code I provide in my editor.\nTweet 3/8\nTo start, I needed to learn the framework myself. I tasked AMP with porting a to-do app I’d built in another framework (FastHTML) over to Air. I just gave it both projects in my workspace and a prompt. It successfully generated a working app.\nTweet 4/8\nWell, almost working. The first version had a bug with database writes. I copied the server logs, fed them back to AMP, and it identified and fixed the issue on the first try. Impressive.\n\n\n\nA screenshot showing AMP’s response after fixing the database error.\n\n\nTweet 5/8\nWith a working app, I understood the layout patterns. Next, I prompted AMP to write the “Layouts Concepts Guide” based on the code it just helped create.\nTweet 6/8\nThis is where the “human in the loop” part comes in. The first draft was a great start but went way off-scope, adding sections on forms, error pages, etc. My main job was simplification—deleting large chunks and refining the code examples.\n\n\n\nA screenshot showing the final, clean structure of the documentation that was merged.\n\n\nTweet 7/8\nThe editing process was still way faster than starting from scratch. The final guide was clean, well-structured, and is now part of the official Air documentation.\nTweet 8/8\nFinal verdict: For the coding task, AMP was a huge win. For documentation, it was helpful but comparable to other top-tier models. The real power was the seamless workflow from code generation to writing.\nRead the full, detailed breakdown here: [Link to your blog post]"

These needed to be matched up to a HTML reference documentation, and agents kept leaving off or added tags. Cursor’s tab comletion let me copy/paste from reference docs then hit tab for it to tab complete and modify to python syntax very quickly. It got the pattern after the first couple and let me get through it all in very little time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnhelpful Use Case\n\n\n\nI was working on creating examples for a workshop I was teaching on FastHTML Syntax and Project Organization. The tab completion was extremely annoying, because it was project wide it kept trying to autocomplete and change my code to what I did somewhere else. I felt like I was fighting the tab completion constantly and having to keep telling it to go away A LOT because I had a very specific thing in mind I wanted to do."

    "text": "LinkedIn Post: AMP Tool Review\nTitle: Putting AI to the Test: From Code Generation to Documentation with the AMP Agent\nI recently ran an experiment to see how a modern AI agent handles a real-world, start-to-finish open-source contribution. I used AMP to create the “Layouts Concepts” guide for Air, a new web framework. The task was a great test because it required both generating code to understand the framework and then writing the official documentation based on that code.\nThe results were impressive and highlighted the real strengths (and current limitations) of AI-assisted development.\nThe Process:\n\nCode Generation: I started by asking AMP to port a to-do application from another framework (FastHTML) to Air. Since Air is in alpha and not in public training data, the agent had to rely entirely on the source code I provided in my workspace. It successfully generated a functional application.\nAI-Powered Debugging: The initial app had a bug in the database logic. I simply fed the server logs back into AMP, and it correctly identified and fixed the error on its first attempt.\nDocumentation Writing: With a working application providing the necessary patterns, I then tasked AMP with writing the concepts guide.\n\nThe “Human in the Loop” Reality:\nWhile AMP dramatically accelerated the process, it wasn’t a “one-click” solution. The agent’s first draft of the documentation was a solid foundation but required significant manual refinement. I had to: - Remove large sections of irrelevant, out-of-scope content that the agent added. - Simplify and consolidate the code examples to make them clearer for educational purposes. - Restructure the narrative to flow logically for a developer audience.\nThis editing phase was crucial, but it was still far more efficient than writing the entire guide from a blank page.\nFinal Verdict:\nFor the coding and debugging portion, AMP was a clear productivity multiplier. For the documentation writing, it provided a strong starting point, comparable to what I’d expect from other top models like Claude 3 Opus or Gemini 1.5 Pro.\nThe real win was the seamless end-to-end workflow. The final PR was accepted and merged into the official Air documentation. This experiment shows that with the right approach, AI agents are becoming incredibly powerful tools for tangible software development tasks.\nYou can read my full, detailed review of the entire process here: [Link to your blog post]\n#AI #AIAgents #DeveloperTools #SoftwareDevelopment #OpenSource #AMP #ContextEngineering #FutureOfCoding\n\n\n\nThe blog post title card for the AMP tool review"

However, not every tool or library provides curated context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood For\n\n\n\n\nYou want to explore more deeply\nIt’s provided by the tool author in some format\n\n\n\n\n_BraintrustPhoenixInspectManual Approaches\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.0.1 MCP (Model Context Protocol)\nBraintrust provides a MCP server that your AI agents can use. This is a lot like GitMCP we saw above, but created by the Braintrust team specifically for Braintrust so it’s much better.\n\nOfficial MCP server: https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/reference/mcp\nProvides structured access to Braintrust functionality\n\nTo set up the MCP server with Cursor, you can use the following settings.\n\n\n\nCursor MCP Settings\n\n\n\n\n\nCursor MCP Json\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.0.2 LLMs.txt\nPhoenix provides an file based in the llms.txt spec format. This is a format that allows for use as static context in a flat file, or as a tool that an MCP server can use to crawl it agentally.\n\nStandard Format for Pheonix: https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/llms.txt\nLangchain MCP documentation tool: https://github.com/langchain-ai/mcpdoc\n\n\n\n\n\n5.0.0.3 llms.txt\nFor Pheonix, I provided a link to lanchain’s MCP server that lets you use the llms.txt file as a tool. For Inspect, let’s use the llms.txt spec to use the flat files as context to see the difference.\n\nStandard format: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/llms.txt\nFull version: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/llms-full.txt\nIndividual Pages as Context: https://inspect.aisi.org.uk/index.html.md\n\n\n\n\nManual curation of context is also a great way to have the most control. There is typically a tradeoff between the amount of time you spend curating the context and the quality of the context. You will get better results if you spend more time carefully curating the context, and whether that payoff is worth the time is dependent on a few things:\n\nHow long will you be using this tool and how much? If you use it daily and will for years, it’s worth the time to curate the context.\nHow good is the library provided context? If they have carefully curated the context for llms specifically and the tool authors use it themselves, the often it works pretty great out of the box. Sadly, most tools don’t do this (yet).\n\n\n5.0.0.4 Jina AI\nJina AI is an easy way to turn any html page into a markdown file. Markdown is much better context for HTML, because there’s loads of unneccesary noise in the HTML that doesn’t add value (styling classes, js interactivity, server calls, social media icons, etc.)\n\n\n\n5.0.0.5 Copy Outer HTML\nBy going more manual you can remove the noise and get a more focused context. This is a great way to get a more focused context, but it’s a more work. The main benefits here over Jina AI is you often can remove lots of unneeded sections like footers, table of contents, sidebars, navigation, etc.\nCopying the outer HTML and feeding that into Web2Md is the best workflow I’ve found for this.\n\n\n\n5.0.0.6 Web 2 MD"
