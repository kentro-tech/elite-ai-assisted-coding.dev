  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>For the next tool review in my series, I decided to use the Gemini CLI.</p>
<section id="the-task" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-task">The Task</h2>
<p>My desktop is cluttered with ~ a billion unnamed screenshots and screen recordings. I’ve wanted to clean them for a while, but renaming them is a huge pain.</p>
<p>Because the Gemini models are to be the best at multimodal tasks like image and video, Gemini CLI felt like it should be a good choice. I decided to tackle this in 2 phases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Try using the Gemini CLI out of the box to rename this files with 0 effort by looking at image and video content.</li>
<li>Create a desktop app that has file navigations and single vs bulk file renaming to make a genral solution.</li>
</ol>
<p>That way I should get a good feel for the tool’s capabilities and learn a bit about building a desktop app. This review is part of my research for my “AI Assisted Coding” course, where I teach how to get the most out of AI tools.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="using-the-gemini-cli-for-renaming">Using the Gemini CLI for Renaming</h2>
<p>I fired up the Gemini CLI and gave it the task of renaming the files without any code. [00:01:24] I was pleased to see that it did a great job of analyzing the content of the images and videos and suggesting meaningful names.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">

</div>
<p>The CLI renamed a batch of files, and the new names were descriptive and accurate. [00:01:42]</p>

<p>Here’s another example of the CLI renaming a screenshot with a descriptive name. [00:01:39]</p>

<p>The tool also handled video files (<code>.mov</code>) just as effectively as images. [00:02:00]</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>It didn’t keep track of the work progress well however. I found that the CLI would sometimes stop a lot before completing the entire task, and I had to remind it to do a <code>ls | grep Screenshot</code> of the directory to see if there’s more to do to get it to continue. [00:02:15]</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-a-desktop-app-with-the-gemini-cli">Building a Desktop App with the Gemini CLI</h2>
<p>Once I confirmed that the core functionality was possible, I moved on to building a desktop application to make this renaming process easier in the future. I hadn’t built a desktop app before, so this was fun.</p>
<p>A feature I particularly liked was the ability to modify the proposed changes in an external editor before applying them. [00:03:09] This gave me more a bit more control.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

<p>I chose to open in cursor, and it gave me an editable diff view I could modify before the changes are applied.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>The Gemini CLI also generated a plan for the application before it started coding, which is nice. Claude Code and many other tools do this too. But it’s still nice. [00:03:33]</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">

</figure>
</div>
<p>The end result was a functional-ish, but very buggy, desktop application. I was able to select a directory, have the AI suggest new names for the files, and then apply those names. [00:03:54]</p>

<section id="code-quality-and-bugs" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="code-quality-and-bugs">Code Quality and Bugs</h2>
<p>While the app “worked,” it had several major bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li>I couldn’t select individual files, and the app would often hang after processing one directory. [00:04:06]</li>
<li>After doing it’s first bulk rename operation it would somehow get into a state where no additional renamings would work so the whole app would need to be restarted. There were no errors logged.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I dove into the code more carefully, I found the common AI code culprits such as overuse of generic <code>try...except</code> blocks that would catch exceptions and simply print them to the console. [00:04:57] This hides bugs and make the application less robust and harder to fix but appear to work at a glance.</p>

<section id="final-thoughts" class="level1">
<h1>Final Thoughts</h1>
<p>Overall, I have found the Gemini CLI to be pretty useful, especially for multimodal tasks like analyzing images and videos. [00:06:36] Its ability to generate descriptive names for my screenshots and videos with 0 effort was really nice. The code it generated for the desktop application was a good starting point and a valuable learning tool, I don’t really think it’s better than claude code.</p>
<p>The code was understandable enough and I followed along with the code generation process enough that I understood what it was doing a learned a bit about making a desktop app. However, if I were to build a desktop app for this for real I would start over rather than continue to work with this code.</p>
<p>While not included in this use, for tasks like content creation, writing, and quick, one-off multimodal tasks, Gemini is fantastic. For software development, I think there are better options.</p>

<section id="overview" class="level1">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Cursor is a fork of VS Code that integrates AI assistance throughout the development workflow. It is worth trying because it is a full IDE that gives a great diff experience on AI changes, and is very aggressive with the AI assistance. Cursor is one of the tools I use day-to-day for coding and it’s a great tool.</p>

<h1>Top IDE Features</h1>
<section id="tab-completion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="tab-completion">Tab Completion</h2>
<p>Cursor’s completions use project-wide context rather than just the current file and are very aggressive, which is good in some situations and annoying in others.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I was doing an <a href="https://github.com/feldroy/air/pull/143/files#diff-e14fd0d1e563b32e21626eaeba650c79ce24651dfe03c83a5d977372384ff8ec">OSS PR to add type hints</a> to a new web development framework called <code>air</code> (very repetitive task). These needed to be matched up to a HTML reference documentation, and agents kept leaving off or added tags. Cursor’s tab comletion let me copy/paste from reference docs then hit tab for it to tab complete and modify to python syntax very quickly. It got the pattern after the first couple and let me get through it all in very little time.</p>

<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I was working on creating examples for a workshop I was teaching on <a href="https://github.com/kentro-tech/fasthtml-routes-and-syntax-ws/tree/main">FastHTML Syntax and Project Organization</a>. The tab completion was extremely annoying, because it was project wide it kept trying to autocomplete and change my code to what I did somewhere else. I felt like I was fighting the tab completion constantly and having to keep telling it to go away A LOT because I had a very specific thing in mind I wanted to do.</p>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section id="chatagent-interface-cmdl-cmdi" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chatagent-interface-cmdl-cmdi">Chat/Agent Interface (<code>Cmd+L</code> <code>Cmd+I</code>)</h2>
<p>Context-aware chat that understands project structure. This is pretty helpful with being able to easily reference lots of things with the <code>@</code> syntax for files. If you have code highlighted when you engage it that will be included in context specifically, and open files will also be in context for you.</p>
<div class="callout callout-style-default callout-tip callout-titled" title="Usage Tip">
<div class="callout-header d-flex align-content-center">
<div class="callout-icon-container">
<i class="callout-icon"></i>
</div>
<div class="callout-title-container flex-fill">
Usage Tip
</div>
</div>
<div class="callout-body-container callout-body">
<p>I find it really helpful to dump lots of things in a <code>ref</code> folder then <code>@</code> like everything useful as I go. This can be tutorials I found online, docs, etc. I can <code>@</code> the URL directly, but the <code>ref</code> folder serves as an aggregator for me that’s a bit easier to keep top of mind and curate as needed than the cursor docs feature IMO.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The Agent gives many options and you get really nice diffs that you can individually review, or accept all, and you can restore back to checkpoints if you accepted changes that you find don’t work well after testing.</p>
</section>
<section id="inline-editor-cmdk" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inline-editor-cmdk">Inline Editor (<code>Cmd+K</code>)</h2>
<p>Edit code in place with AI assistance <code>Cmd+K</code>. This lets you target specific pieces of code to edit. This is extremely helpful for limiting the scope of AI, especially when it’s trying to do too much or you know exactly where the change should happen.</p>
<p>I often use this to quickly ask it to write a doc string for documentation, or to do things like refactor a hairy logic stuck iside loops or conditionals into functions.</p>
</section>
<section id="terminal-helped-also-cmdk" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="terminal-helped-also-cmdk">Terminal helped (also <code>Cmd+K</code>)</h2>
<p>In your terminal you can select <code>Cmd+K</code> to have an AI assist that sees that terminals history. This is super helpful for lots of things, like telling you how to run things, git commands you’ve forgotten, telling it to do some curl command you don’t remember all the flags you need, etc.</p>
<p>The <strong>really</strong> nice thing about <code>Cmd+K</code> is it’s very controlled, so it puts the command in your terminal but YOU must run it. This makes it nice because I can ask it to help with even fairly risk things because it won’t be running anything on it’s own.</p>
</section>
<section id="cursor-rules" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cursor-rules">Cursor Rules</h2>
<p>Cursor Rules are extremely helpful and there’s 4 modes:</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://ai-context-engineering.com/static/CursorRulesOptions.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<figcaption>Cursor Rules Options</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always Apply</strong> - Core rules that should never be violated</li>
<li><strong>Apply Manually</strong> - Rules you trigger when needed. If you’re really bad at thinking about context, and you’re not going to put a lot of effort in then don’t use this.</li>
<li><strong>Apply Intelligently</strong> - This is a great thing to use and provide a good description for the agent to know when to use it.</li>
<li><strong>Apply to Specific Files</strong> - File-type or path-specific rules. This can be nice, but you’re liable to set it to a path, restructure something, then forget and this rule will be acidentally deprecated. This is useful in a decently mature code base, or with very general paths like <code>src</code> or <code>docs</code> directory that are not likely to change.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section id="additional-features" class="level1">
<h1>Additional Features</h1>
<ul>
<li>Background Agents: These are great to bring some of what you do in cursor for easier tasks to run in parallel</li>
<li>Slack/Github Integration: A nice features to do additional tasks and ask cursor to work on things from Slack or from a github repo. I didn’t find it as useful for actual coding things, as I found going to the IDE, adding additional context and thinking about the task instructions for formulate payed dividends. But for writing tasks it was a great easy starting point!</li>
</ul>
